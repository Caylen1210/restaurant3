    <h2> About Me </h2>
<p>My name is Caylen Joseph and I am a current student of the Techhire program. To go into to a little detail about me personally, I am 22 years old and currently reside in Elmont New York. I have a strong instrest in fashion and design. The interest stems from my first semester in college when my roommates helped expand my knowledge on fabric, how to mis and match. Some hoobies im interested besides fashion is sports.Growing up in my household sports was a major thing that brought my family together for bonding. Events like the world series, NBA finals held weight with bonding. </p> 
    
    <p>Furthhermore, what brought me to coding was the ability to create from scratch. It always seemed very interesting on how someone can start with a blank page and essientally bring to life someones vision. Futhermore, the major goal I want to accompish from this progam is to work as a front end developer from a fashion firm. I know if that is a major goal that I have I have to become more effiecent in programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator and things of that sort. I see coding as an opportunity to become self made with freelancing and being able to have a flexible schedule. I see this skill set as a value skill set to learn especially in this day and age. With everything going in the direction of technology, it opens coding to connecting to so many different crafts.  </p>
    <h2> Past Experiences </h2> 
    <p> A few accomplishments I have from recent memory is becoming initiated into Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. Through the fraterntiy I have gained so many resources that has opened opportunies. Another recent accomplishment happned in 2018 when I embarked on a longtime goal of creating a fashion line. I was able to start RNSE nyc and express some of my values and creativity through the art of clothing. </p>
    
<p> Another accomplishment of mine was completing the the vestabule for the techhire program. At first I didn't know what to expect from the program,but so far it has been very impacting. It causes youto be self accountable and knowing how well I want to do, I know that I have to lock in and really apply effort to be successful for after the program. After the first week, I knew if I apply full effort, its very achievable to be successful as a web developer.</p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p> One of my hobbies that I do is going to the gym. Although it sounds clich√®, I developed a daily schedule to incorprate excerise into my schedule. I realized that I want to have a life of quality and longevity so this was a major step in doing this. Beore the program I was able to go about 4-5 days a week. Afte rthe first week of the program, it became much harder to have a consistent schedule to workout. Now I work around my school schedule pushing more to go during the weekends since the week becomes very hectic. </p>
    <p> Another hoobie of mine is traveling.one major trip was around last year, one of my friends offered me the opprotunity to go with him to Paris for two weeks. I started crewating a savings plan ans realized how easy it is to travel if you approach it correctly. It was a life changing experience made me approach life different after seeing more what the world has to offer. </p>
